message: "Hi Bill,\r\n\r\nWith the host file, you can block any websites but not all of them because you can't use something like a regex. However, there must be some local proxy solutions that would allow you to better control all this, but I would rather not recommend any: I don't have enough perspective on their qualities and flaws."
