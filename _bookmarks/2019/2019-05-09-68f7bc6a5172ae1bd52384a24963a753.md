<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The bittersweet consequence of YouTubeâ€™s incredible growth is that so many stories will be lost underneath all of the layers of new paint. This is why I wanted to tell the story of how, ten years ago, a small team of web developers conspired to kill IE6 from inside YouTube and got away with it.
