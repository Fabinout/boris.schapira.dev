<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p><strong>Our current generation of frameworks makes off-main-thread architectures hard and diminishes its returns</strong>. UI frameworks are supposed to do UI work and therefore have the right to run on the UI thread. In reality, however, the work they are doing is a mixture of UI work and other related, but ultimately non-UI work.
