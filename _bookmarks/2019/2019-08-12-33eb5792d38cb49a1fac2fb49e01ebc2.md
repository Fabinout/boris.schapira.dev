<p>To summarise, using native lazy loading is one of the simplest ways of providing genuine progressive performance enhancements for your users. It’s not a perfect solution, but if you’re not already utilising lazy loading and have lots of images/iframes it’s definitely worth trying out — especially as it’s so easy to implement!
