<div class="markdown"><p>So which method should you use to load your webfonts? Unfortunately the answer is it depends:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re looking for a quick and simple method you can have working within an hour, use Amazon’s method</li>
<li>If you want something a bit more thorough and are alright with the limited browser support for now, try using font-display: optional</li>
<li>And if you really want to make an effort to optimize your webfont loading, take the dive and look into the localStorage technique<br />
</li>
</ul></div>
