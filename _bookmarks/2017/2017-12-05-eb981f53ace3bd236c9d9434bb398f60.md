<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Image placeholders in SVG are ready for prime time thanks to browser support and good rendering performance. By automating SVG shape creation that mimics main features visible inside an image and compressing the result appropriately, we can achieve SVG-based image placeholders weighing in at only ~400 bytes. SQIP is a tool to make this process easy to integrate into your deployments.&quot;
