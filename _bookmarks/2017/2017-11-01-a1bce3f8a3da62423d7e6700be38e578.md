<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Nobody likes to wait for web pages to load in the browser. The longer it takes, the more dissatisfied the users become. Slow web pages lead to a higher bounce rate and the loss of customers. To solve this kind of problems can be very hard sometimes. Before you even start to optimise your page, you have to understand the workflows a browser performs in order to display a page on the screen.&quot;
