<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;This post demonstrates some of the changes we did to improve our search experience. Combined with a number of optimisations on the back end to improve the performance of trade search, we were able to get the search results to appear below one second, even when searching through nearly half a million vehicles. In a future post, we will look at what changes were needed on the server side to improve search performance.&quot;
