<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I want to be very clear: I believe AMP is a framework designed with good intentions, aimed at solving the very real problem of a web thatâ€™s gotten far, far too slow for its users. But using AMP? The cost for the web, and for those who do business on it, is much, much too high.&quot;
