<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Whenever performance testing AMP, keep in mind that a test from origin will include potentially suboptimal server settings like bad cache headers or missing image optimizations. Also the biggest speed gain (near instant load through prerendering) will not be reflected in commonly used performance tools and metrics.&quot;
