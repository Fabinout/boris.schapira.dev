<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Third-party scripts are probably the #1 cause of poor performance and bad UX on the web. It's no wonder things like AMP exist. The fact that it disallows third-party scripts is probably the largest contributor to it making sites fast. Controversial as hell, though, in its other choices.&quot;
