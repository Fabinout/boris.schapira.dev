<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Managing your service worker cache invalidation is a key step in making your progressive web app a rich robust experience. It ensures that the content your customer sees and interacts with is the freshest content possible. It also guards your app from overstepping the cache quota and potentially causing a complete purge of everything you stored.&quot;
