<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;PowerShell is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux and OS X) automation and configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models. It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language and a framework for processing cmdlets.&quot;
