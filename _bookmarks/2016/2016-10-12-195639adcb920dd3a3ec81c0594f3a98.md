<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;JavaScript is great, and by all means use it, while also being aware that you can build so many functional UI components without the additional dependancy.</p>
<p>Maybe you can include a few lines of utility code, or a mixin, and forgo the requirement. If you're only targeting more modern browsers, you might not need anything more than what the browser ships with.&quot;
