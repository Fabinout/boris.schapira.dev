<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I’ve been using Promises in my JavaScript code for a while now. They can be a little brain bending at first. I now use them pretty effectively, but when it came down to it, I didn’t fully understand how they work. This article is my resolution to that. If you stick around until the end, you should understand Promises well too.&quot;
