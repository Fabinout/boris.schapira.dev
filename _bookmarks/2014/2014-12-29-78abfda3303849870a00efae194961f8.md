This is an easy and effective way to protect you from many types of spyware, reduces bandwidth use, blocks certain pop-up traps, prevents user tracking by way of &quot;web bugs&quot; embedded in spam provides partial protection to IE from certain web-based exploits and blocks most advertising you would otherwise be subjected to on the  internet.
