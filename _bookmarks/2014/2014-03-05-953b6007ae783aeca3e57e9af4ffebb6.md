<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;If you are an old hat at Sass, chances are you've got an opinion about which syntax is better. And there are a lot of good people on both sides of the aisle. Some prefer Sass, the original syntax - while others prefer SCSS. Either way, there's no need for panic or worry.&quot;
