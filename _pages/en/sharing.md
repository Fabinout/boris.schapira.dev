I'm deeply convinced that sharing and teaching are the only way to truly
understand something. I teached ([ECV Digital](https://www.ecvdigital.fr/),
[Ing√©sup](https://www.ingesup.com/ 'Ingesup')),
[I like sandwiches](https://www.brownbaglunch.fr/baggers.html#Boris_Schapira_Bordeaux 'BrownBagLunch France')
and I attend too many conferences, both as attendee or speacker, and organized
both [Sud Web](https://sudweb.fr/ 'SudWeb.fr') and
[We Love Speed](https://www.welovespeed.com/ 'We Love Speed').

Most of my contributions are [in French](/partager/).
