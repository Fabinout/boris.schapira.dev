I'm deeply convinced that sharing and teaching are the only way to truly understand something. I teach at the [ECV Digital](http://www.ecvdigital.fr/) School but you could have met me before at [Ing√©sup Bordeaux](https://www.ingesup.com/ "Ingesup"). I can [speack about a technical subject in exchange of a sandwich](https://www.brownbaglunch.fr/baggers.html#Boris_Schapira_Bordeaux "BrownBagLunch France") and I participated to many conferences, both as attendee, team member or speacker, from Barcelona to Paris. My favorite one is [Sud Web](https://sudweb.fr/ "SudWeb.fr").

Most of my contributions are [in French](/partage/).
